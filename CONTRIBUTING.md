I'd like to thank my family for being supportive, and definitely myself.
I'm the best guy in the world, and still waiting that people finally realise it.

Just a joke, but as you will understand, it's late again... and I'm tired. 
I'm going throw up probably, take a shower and go for a good night of sleep.


As usual, to thank you for reading this, here's a joke:


 “I got a package in the post last week, and on it it said, ‘Please don’t bend.’
 So how was I supposed to pick it up?”
